    Setup includes several steps with limited explaination - as shown here:
    ```
    =================================
    ========== To Do List ===========
    =================================
    0: Delete "ThumbnailCamera" from "CandsavorOrdersModel" if you want.
    1: Make sure the "CandsavorOrdersModel" is located in Workspace & nothing is moved 
    or renamed.
    2: From 'Game Settings' > 'Security' > Turn 'Allow Http Request' on
    3: From CandsavorOrders folder's "Configuration" ModuleScript, configure the model.
    4: Select any item you want to clone, press Control + D, clone it and move it to your
    desired place. Make sure the item you clone's "ClassName" is "Model"
    5: Go in-game, check for errors in Console (press f9 > Server) and try to fix.
    6: If you cannot get to fix any problem, join our discord server and contract support.
