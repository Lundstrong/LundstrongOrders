It is suggested to follow this guide so that you can make sure that your GUI is not overwritten accidently by rojo. Firstly, start the Rojo server on both sides and connect to it. Then, once you have got the latest updates, you can modify scripts (in VSC!) & the GUI (In studio) to your liking. When you are ready to import it back to Visual Studio Code, please do the following. Please set the GUI back to its normal enabled state, and make sure the frames visible are the ones which were visible originally. (IE: Only home should be visible for CashierGui) Right Click on the GUI, and click Save to file Change the Save as type: from .rbxm to .rbxmx . This is very important , as otherwise rojo will not be able to understand the GUI (Once version 7 of rojo is released, we will be able move to a binary file for GUI). Save it in the folder for the GUI and overwrite the old one. Important If your rojo server disconnects for some reason, do not reconnect . It will overwrite your progress. Just keep on working until you have imported the GUI but be aware your scripts will not sync.","title":"Modifying the GUI"},{"location":"contributing/setup/","text":"Warning Please note that this section for how to setup LundstrongOrders for Development. We do not recommend following this unless you know what you are doing! To setup LundstrongOrders for Development, you will need to setup the Visual Studio Code part, and the Roblox part.
